Institutions and administrators regularly have to make difficult choices about how best to invest resources to serve students. Grants from
federal, state, and philanthropic agencies provide additional funds for the development, testing, and evaluation of innovative 
undergraduate education programs, which, if demonstrated to be effective, often are expected to be sustained from other sources when grant
funding ends. Yet the changing landscape in postsecondary education, including increasing enrollment, expanding access, and decreasing 
state-level investment, is putting added pressure on postsecondary education budgets.
But economic evaluation, or the systematic analysis of the relationship between costs and outcomes of a program or policy, is relatively 
uncommon in higher education. This type of evaluation can be an important tool for decision makers considering questions of resource 
allocation.

the structure of their investment and where should they invest more.
