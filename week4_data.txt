Data of various Data Science Universities in USA have been collected using foursquare. The data consists of school name, state name, 
Location of school. Another similar dataset have been taken from kaggle giving various informations about the schools. This data contains
School name of the university, City name, NOC score of the university which tells about type of jobs,Program which gives about the 
program delivered, Delivery which tells about the mode of education, Teaching score, research score, citations score of the university,
total score, number of students in that program in the university. These variables can make useful features for our problem and we can 
further analyze and remove the correlated features or make new features. Both the data can be merged and clustered based on various 
factors. Clusters have been visualized using the location data provided by foursquare through folim map.
